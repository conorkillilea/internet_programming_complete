		<p class="quotetext"> "Grupetto" : The name given to the group of cyclists in a road cycling race who form a large group behind the leading peloton.
		Due to the common interest in survival, the mood in the grupetto has a greater sense of camaraderie than in the main peloton. </p>
		
		<p>Grupetto Cycling, in business now for more than 30 years, has grown from humble beginnings 
		as a small shop in Galway to become Ireland's biggest online bicycle store, with the Galway premises still located in the city centre. 
		
		Grupetto Cycling prides itself on the quality and number of brands we carry and the 
		knowledge of the sport we've amassed and are waiting to share with every customer. We have 
		experts across all areas of cycling, from competitive Road and MTB cycling, to the leisure 
		cyclist and everything in between, who are always pleased to share their passion and knowledge and, 
		we believe, this level of expertise is something that strongly marks us out against our competitors. </p>
		
	    <p> Our motto, we ride together, is based on our passion of getting cyclists of all levels together to enjoy cycling at its best,
		with fellow cyclists. To promote this ethos, we organise yearly trips for groups of cyclists
		of every standard to complete stages of the grand tours as well as trips to view the big stages.
		We also organise weekly rides beginning from our shop. </p>
		
		<p> All our bicycles and equipment are available from our online store. 
		You can also join on our trips or book an appointment with our workshop, all through this website. </p>
		
		<p> Please feel free to contact us for more info, the more the merrier!! </p>
